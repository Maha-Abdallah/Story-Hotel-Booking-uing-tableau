**Master Project: Predicting Hotel Cancellation Using Tableau** 
explainable predictions of booking cancellation to decrease uncertainty and
increase revenue.
**Objective:**
The main objective of this master project is to gain a deeper insight into hotel data and discover the best model for predicting hotel cancellations. By analyzing the data, the project aims to identify the most significant factors that affect hotel cancellations and provide valuable business recommendations to reduce cancellations and increase profitability.

**Abstract:**
Effective analysis in the hotel industry is crucial for maximizing profitability. Understanding the factors that lead to satisfied and loyal customers is essential for increasing revenue and minimizing cancellation rates. This project focuses on determining customer characteristics and identifying the key factors influencing hotel cancellations. Based on the findings, actionable recommendations will be proposed to enhance customer satisfaction, reduce cancellations, and ultimately improve overall profitability.

**Background of the Industry:**
The hotel industry is a vital component of the travel and tourism sector, with a global value exceeding $570 billion in 2019 and comprising approximately 18 million rooms. The United States holds the largest market share, accounting for around 51% of global revenue. The industry has witnessed consistent growth, driven by increasing income levels, rising travel demands, and advancements in technology, which have facilitated better accessibility for travelers.

**Business Problem:**
In this project, the focus lies in forecasting hotel booking cancellations using data from hotel reservations. The key business questions to address are:
1. Will a customer cancel their booking?
2. If yes, what are the driving factors behind these cancellations?

**Importance of the Problem:**
Predicting hotel demand and cancellation rates is crucial for optimizing resource allocation within hotels. By anticipating demand, hotel management can efficiently allocate staff to handle front desk operations, restaurants, and housekeeping. Moreover, this predictive analysis helps in estimating the demand for in-hotel subsidiary businesses such as gift shops, gyms, and spas, ensuring their services are aligned with expected guest arrivals.

The project utilizes Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, to explore, analyze, and present the findings in an interactive and insightful manner. Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to empower hotel operators with valuable insights that enable them to make informed decisions, improve customer experiences, and drive higher profitability.

In conclusion, this master project serves as a valuable contribution to the hotel industry by providing data-driven solutions to the challenges of hotel cancellations, enhancing operational efficiency, and maximizing revenue. The amalgamation of data analytics and Tableau visualization will enable better decision-making and establish a strong foundation for sustainable growth in the competitive landscape of the hospitality sector.
